# üëó  AI OUTFIT JUDGER


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Luna


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adithya A - GECI
- Member 2: Fathima MS - GECI

### Project Description
The **AI Dress Detector** is a machine learning‚Äìpowered application that can automatically identify and classify clothing items from images.  
It uses advanced computer vision techniques and AI models to detect the type, color, and style of dresses in real time or from uploaded pictures.
It gives 2 messages "burn it" or "nice" and also shows the percentage rating of the outfit.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This site is used to judge your outfit of the day, we don't want to go out looking like a monkey. We may go out like that if we don't have that friend, so to solve that problem we have our ai dress detector app, which helps you to check your overall outfit and give you the opinion.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Nobody wanted a website, no one actually takes their phone go to google and search for our website while they are busy heading out. So actually this website is pointless.
